We'll be working with the web application at: https://glitch.com/~board-connection-check

You can remix it either anonymously or on your own Glitch account.

There are three Arduino sketches included here for demonstration purposes.

1. Board Connection Check - send a request to `/ping` with network-related details for your device / sketch.
2. Send Word - send word, phrase, character, or symbol to `/word`. We'll see an example of what we can do with this data in the web application.
3. Get Word - get a random word from the existing collection.

The sketches can be combined, further separated or otherwise remixed to provide new interactions over the web.

There's also a p5js sketch that demonstrates retrieving data from our app. It's also built into board-connection-check at https://board-connection-check.glitch.me/sketch
