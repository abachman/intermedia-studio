# Project 2

Remotely controlled devices.

Guidelines:   
- The purpose or function can be abstract, but...
- Every feature of the device should be accessible remotely.
- The device should be connected by network to a control or measurement system.
- All measurement recording and control should happen from a different machine (computer, mobile phone, or another physical computing device).
- The device may use a micro USB connection, but it should be for power only.

Keywords:  
- Sensing, reacting, activating, deactivating.

Tools available for use:
- Relay shield
- Control pad / Indicator
- Sound playback shield

Exploration goals:   
- Remote interaction
- Space modification  
- Things that "learn"
- Communication with objects

Questions for discovery:
- What changes when we share more of our space with objects that can communicate?
- When so much of my experience of the world is mediated by devices, how can I tell I am interacting with a device and not a person?
- How can I know that a person is changing my space?
- Is action more meaningful when a person initiates it?  
- Is measurement more meaningful when the change in environment affects people?
