# Guidelines for the first project

Concrete requirements:

1. At least one data flow. Data flows include data sent to or from a hardware device or screen interface (Processing sketch, web page, or small game).
1. Involves the Huzzah as either an input or an output. This means it somehow receives data from the environment (sensor, button, switch, touch, other interaction) and sends it somewhere or it receives data from the network and expresses it as an output device. Think light, sound, or movement.
1. Whether in person or at a distance (for example, via the web), your project should rely on some form of human interaction for its motivating force. While it can involve generative components (like our random word sketch from session 2), it should not be a purely generative work.
1. You should be able to answer the questions: what choices did you make and why did you make them?

Suggested topic: **communication**. For example, complete one of the following sentences:

- Communication is important because...
- Communication becomes dangerous when...
- Communication has [changed / not changed] in [my lifetime / the last two years / ever]...
- Communication should look more like...

We have studied some of the tools of networked communication, choose an aspect, approach, or small feature of communication that interests you and expand on it.

What I'm looking for, technically speaking: I am not looking for fresh code from scratch, I am more concerned with the resulting expression of your ideas and how you use any code you have. Remixes of any example sketch or project we have encountered in class so far are okay and even encouraged.

Regarding code and technical assistance: I am willing to offer technical guidance and suggestions. I will not be able to write new code or build circuits for you, but I am happy to help you decide what code to write or what circuits to build. Please schedule a time to meet or reach out via Slack or email if you have any concerns about your ability to put together a project over the next two weeks.

Simple is okay! Simple and complete is better than complex and incomplete. This is our first project of three, so there is time and space to go deeper in future projects.
