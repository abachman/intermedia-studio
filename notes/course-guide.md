## Description

The goal of this course is to invite students to explore and develop their studio practice in the context of multi-platform interactive technologies spanning software applications, connected objects, smart devices, and physical computing with a specific focus on the Internet of Things.

Through the introduction of technical concepts and creative software and hardware platforms, we will be building complete projects and inventing new technologies to explore connection, detection, measurement, interaction, security, movement, light, sound, and control across physical and virtual boundaries.

Through the use of smaller and more frequent projects rather than larger, singular works, we will have more opportunities to play, fail, learn, and grow in both understanding and ability.


## Standards / Expectations

* Be able to complete functional interactive art works composing of original hardware and software components (make stuff)
* Demonstrate the rapid prototyping of new ideas in code and in hardware (sketch ability)
* Demonstrate the practice of creating new work based on existing projects (remixing / extending)
* Demonstrate the ability to communicate with collaborators on projects outside the abilities of a single individual (we go further together)
* Be able to properly constrain the scope of an original project to a level suitable for completion within the available time (project time estimation)
* Demonstrate understanding of various technologies used to create connected and interactive art works (know your tools)
* Develop extensive documentation for all projects (show your work)
* Be able to communicate the intent and expression of the things you create (talk about your work)

# MICA Notices

## Attendance

You are expected to be at every class unless you have a valid excuse.

Arriving more than 15 minutes after class start is counted as an unexcused absence. Two undexcused absences will result in a reduced grade. Three unexcused absences will result in a failing grade for the course, as per MICA policy.

## Academic Accommodations - Americans

MICA makes reasonable academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. All academic accommodations must be approved through the Learning Resource Center (LRC). Students requesting accommodations should schedule an appointment at the LRC (410-225-2416 or email LRC@mica.edu), located in Bunting 110. It is the student's responsibility to make an accommodation request in a timely manner.

## Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)

Students are responsible to follow health and safety guidelines relevant to their individual activities, processes, and to review MICA's Emergency Action Plan and attend EHS training. Students are required to purchase personal protection equipment appropriate for their major or class. Those students who do not have the proper personal protection equipment will not be permitted to attend class until safe measures and personal protection are in place.

## Plagiarism

Each discipline within the arts has specific and appropriate means for students to cite or acknowledge sources and the ideas and material of others used in their own work. Students have the responsibility to become familiar with such processes and to carefully follow their use in developing original work.

### Policy

MICA will not tolerate plagiarism, which is defined as claiming authorship of, or using someone else's ideas or work without proper acknowledgement. Without proper attribution, a student may NOT replicate another's work, paraphrase another's ideas, or appropriate images in a manner that violates the specific rules against plagiarism in the student's department. In addition, students may not submit the same work for credit in more than one course without the explicit approval of all of the instructors of the courses involved.

### Consequences

When an instructor has evidence that a student has plagiarized work submitted for course credit, the instructor will confront the student and impose penalties that may include failing the course. In the case of a serious violation or repeated infractions from the same student, the instructor will report the infractions to the department chair or program director. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the department chair or program director may then report the student to the appropriate dean or provost, who may choose to impose further penalties, including expulsion.

### Appeal Process

Students who are penalized by an instructor or department for committing plagiarism have the right to appeal the charge and penalties that ensue. Within three weeks of institutional action, the student must submit a letter of appeal to the department chairperson of the course for which actions were taken. The chairperson will assign three members of the relevant department to serve on a review panel. The panel will meet with the student and the instructor of record and will review all relevant and available materials. The panel will determine whether or not to confirm the charge and penalties. The findings of the panel are final. The panel will notify the instructor, the chairperson, the student, and the Office of Academic Affairs of their findings and any recommendations for change in penalties.

## Title IX Notification

Maryland Institute College of Art seeks to provide an educational environment based on mutual respect that is free from discrimination and harassment. If you have encountered sexual harassment/misconduct/ assault, please know that there are multiple ways to report it and you are encouraged to do so (www.mica.edu/equal_opportunity). Additionally, in order to meet our commitments to equity and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, faculty and staff members are required to report disclosures of sexual violence made to them by students, except when prior notice regarding a specific classroom assignment or discussion is provided. If you require academic accommodations due to an incident involving sexual harassment or discrimination, please contact Student Affairs at 410.225.2422 or Human Resources at 410.225.2363.

## Students with Extended Illness or Cause for Legitimate Absence

In the case of extended illness or other absences that may keep the student from attending a class for more than three meetings, undergraduate students must contact the Student Development Specialist in the Division of Student Affairs. The Student Development Specialist will then work with the student to determine the cause and appropriateness of the absences and subsequently notify instructors as necessary. Graduate students must contact the instructor, program director, and the Office of Graduate Studies. Students in art education or professional studies programs must contact the Dean for the Center for Art Education or the Associate Dean for Open Studies, respectively. The appropriate administrator will facilitate a conversation with relevant faculty to determine whether the student can achieve satisfactory academic progress, which is ultimately at the sole discretion of the faculty member.
