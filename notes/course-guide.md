## Description

The goal of this course is to invite students to explore and develop their studio practice in the context of multi-platform interactive technologies spanning software applications, connected objects, smart devices, and physical computing with a specific focus on the Internet of Things.

Through the introduction of technical concepts and creative software and hardware platforms, we will be building complete projects and inventing new technologies to explore connection, detection, measurement, interaction, security, movement, light, sound, and control across physical and virtual boundaries.

Through the use of smaller and more frequent projects rather than larger, singular works, we will have more opportunities to play, fail, learn, and grow in both understanding and ability.

## Academic Accommodations

MICA makes reasonable academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. All academic accommodations must be approved through the Learning Resource Center (LRC). Students requesting accommodations should schedule an appointment at the LRC (410-225-2416 or email LRC@mica.edu), located in Bunting 110. It is the student's responsibility to make an accommodation request in a timely manner.

## Standards / Expectations

* Be able to complete functional interactive art works composing of original hardware and software components (make stuff)
* Demonstrate the rapid prototyping of new ideas in code and in hardware (sketch ability)
* Demonstrate the practice of creating new work based on existing projects (remixing / extending)
* Demonstrate the ability to communicate with collaborators on projects outside the abilities of a single individual (we go further together)
* Be able to properly constrain the scope of an original project to a level suitable for completion within the available time (project time estimation)
* Demonstrate understanding of various technologies used to create connected and interactive art works (know your tools)
* Develop extensive documentation for all projects (show your work)
* Be able to communicate the intent and expression of the things you create (talk about your work)

## Supplies / Must Haves

Services and accounts:

* [GitHub account](https://github.com)
* [Adafruit IO / Adafruit account](https://io.adafruit.com)
* A backup service, such as Dropbox or Backblaze -- (there is zero tolerance for lost documentation and associated project artifacts code. Always backup your work.)
* [Glitch account](https://glitch.com)
* [IS3 Slack workgroup account](https://join.slack.com/t/mica-is3-fall-2018/shared_invite/enQtNDEzMTk5MDU3NjM3LTI0NWU0ODYzMTg4N2Q1MDhhZTMwNzYyYWQxN2U3YjMyNmM2ZjdhY2JhNjFhMDAzZTU4NWY5MzE1NzhhY2VkMWI) *contact adam.bachman@gmail.com for an invite if the invitation link doesn't work*

## Attendance

You are expected to be at every class unless you have a valid excuse.

Arriving more than 15 minutes after class start is counted as an unexcused absence. Three unexcused absences will result in a failing grade for the course, as per MICA policy.
